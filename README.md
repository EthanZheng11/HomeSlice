# HomeSlice
CalgaryHacks 2021
## Inspiration
The inspiration for HomeSlice was the growing homeless population every year, and the lack of social housing units to try to reduce this social-economic issue. There are many major cities with neighbourhoods plagued with poverty and unaffordable housing and the municipalities may not know which areas are affected most. This is why HomeSlice was created, to help people realize through easily understood data graphics, that the communities that surround them may be in desperate need of government assistance and intervention.

## What it does
HomeSlice uses open data from cities and parses the information in a way that allows for it to be easily displayed through the use of graphs and visuals. The purpose of HomeSlice is to make people aware of the common issue of homelessness and unaffordable housing in an effort to inspire action among local governments.

## How we built it

## Challenges we ran into
A few members of our group have never worked on a front-end project before, so it was a difficult learning curve to overcome before real progress started to be made. It was also a puzzling task to graph the data effectively with the parameters we were trying to emphasize most.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
The UI/UX design of our website is very user-friendly and pleasant to view. We are also proud of the front-end development that our group has managed to accomplished such as the map and the graphs.

## What we learned
We learned a lot in Javascript and web development. We also learned how to use a data graphing library called ReCharts as well as a UI library called Chakra. We also discovered how to use Leaflet to create an interactive map.

## What's next for HomeSlice
In the future, we would like to allow for users to enter the data of their own cities to be parsed and visualized so they can also be active in the battle the societal-economic issues of poverty, homelessness and unaffordable housing.
